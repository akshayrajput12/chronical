DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read active privacy policy" ON privacy_policy;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read all privacy policies" ON privacy_policy;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert privacy policies" ON privacy_policy;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update privacy policies" ON privacy_policy;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete privacy policies" ON privacy_policy;

-- Create new, more permissive policies for authenticated users

-- Policy for public read access (anyone can read active privacy policy)
CREATE POLICY "Public can read active privacy policy" ON privacy_policy
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);

-- Policy for authenticated users to read all privacy policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read all privacy policies" ON privacy_policy
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Policy for authenticated users to insert privacy policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert privacy policies" ON privacy_policy
