# Cities Detail Page - Streamlined Component Structure

## Overview

The cities detail page has been restructured to match the exact design from the provided reference image. The page now consists of a hero section and a single content section that follows the two-column layout pattern used throughout the website.

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

### Main Page Structure
```
src/app/cities/[slug]/page.tsx
├── CityDetailHero (Hero Section)
├── CityContentSection (Main Content Section)
└── CityServicesSection (Services Navigation Section)
```

### File Organization
```
src/components/cities/
├── city-detail-hero.tsx           # Hero section component
├── city-content-section.tsx       # Main content section
└── city-services-section.tsx      # Services navigation section
```

We provide complete display stand solutions, including designing, planning, fabricating and erecting and putting up."
