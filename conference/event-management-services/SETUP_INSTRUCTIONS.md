# Event Management Services Admin System - Setup Instructions

## üìã Overview

This document provides complete setup instructions for the Event Management Services admin management system. The system allows dynamic content management for the event management services section of the conference page.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Execute SQL Schema

**Option A: Main Schema File (Recommended)**
Run the main SQL schema file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
conference/sql/event-management-services-schema.sql
```

**Option B: Simple Step-by-Step (If Option A fails)**
If you encounter the "relation does not exist" error, use the simple version:

```bash
conference/sql/event-management-services-schema-simple.sql
```

**Option C: Cleanup and Reset (If needed)**
If you need to start fresh or fix issues:

```bash
conference/sql/cleanup-event-management-services.sql
```

This will create:
- `event_management_sections` table for content
- `event_management_images` table for image management
- `event-management-images` storage bucket
- RLS policies for security
- Indexes for performance
- Database functions for complex queries
- Initial default data

### 2. Verify Database Setup

After running the schema, verify the setup:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('event_management_sections', 'event_management_images');

-- Check storage bucket
SELECT name FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'event-management-images';

-- Check initial data
SELECT main_heading, is_active FROM event_management_sections;
```

   - **Preview**: See how changes will appear

### Content Management Workflow

1. **Edit Content**:
   - Update main heading and description
   - Modify secondary heading
   - Edit first and second paragraphs
   - Update image alt text

2. **Manage Images**:
   - Upload new images (JPG, PNG, WebP up to 10MB)
   - Activate/deactivate images
   - Delete unused images

3. **Preview Changes**:
   - Use the Preview tab to see how content will appear
   - Save changes to apply to the live website

4. **Save and Publish**:
   - Click "Save Changes" to persist to database
   - Visit `/conference` to see live changes

## üîí Security Features

- Public read access for active content
- Authenticated write access for admin users
- Proper data isolation and protection

### Storage Security
- Public read access for images
- Authenticated upload/delete access
- File type and size restrictions

### Input Validation

## üìä Database Schema Details

### event_management_sections Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- main_heading (TEXT, Required)
- main_description (TEXT, Required)
- secondary_heading (TEXT, Required)
- first_paragraph (TEXT, Required)
- second_paragraph (TEXT, Required)
- main_image_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- main_image_url (TEXT)
- main_image_alt (TEXT)
- is_active (BOOLEAN)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### event_management_images Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- filename, original_filename (TEXT)
- file_path (TEXT, Unique)
- file_size (BIGINT, Max 10MB)
- mime_type (TEXT, Restricted)
- alt_text (TEXT)
- width, height (INTEGER)
- is_active (BOOLEAN)
- display_order (INTEGER)
- created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"relation 'event_management_images' does not exist" Error:**
- This occurs due to circular dependency in table creation
- **Solution 1**: Use the fixed main schema file (already corrected)
- **Solution 2**: Use the simple step-by-step schema file
- **Solution 3**: Run cleanup script first, then schema creation

**"Multiple rows returned" Error:**
- Ensure only one active section exists
- Run cleanup query if needed:
```sql
UPDATE event_management_sections
SET is_active = false
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT id FROM event_management_sections
    ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
);
```

**Foreign Key Constraint Errors:**
- Make sure images table is created before sections table
- Use the simple schema file which creates tables in correct order
- Check that foreign key references are properly defined

**RLS Policy Conflicts:**
- Drop existing policies before recreating
- Use unique policy names to avoid conflicts
- Check for policies with similar names in Supabase dashboard

**Storage Bucket Issues:**
- Verify bucket exists: `SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'event-management-images';`
- Check bucket is public: `public` column should be `true`
- Ensure proper storage policies are applied

**Image Upload Issues:**
- Verify storage bucket exists and is public
- Check file size limits (10MB max)
- Ensure supported formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Check storage policies allow authenticated uploads

**Admin Access Issues:**
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check RLS policies are properly configured
- Verify admin permissions in Supabase Auth

**Content Not Displaying:**
- Check if section is marked as active
- Verify database connection
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure tables have proper data

### Debug Features

**Development Mode:**
- Debug overlay shows current image URL
- Console logging for data fetching
- Detailed error messages

**Production Mode:**
- Clean error handling
- User-friendly messages
- Performance optimizations

## üìà Performance Considerations
