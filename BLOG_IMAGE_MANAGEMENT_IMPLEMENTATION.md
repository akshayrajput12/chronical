## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **New Components Created**

#### **1. Blog Image Service** (`src/services/blog-image.service.ts`)
```typescript
// Key Functions:
- deleteBlogPostImages(postId: string)
- deleteFeaturedAndHeroImages(featuredUrl, heroUrl)
- uploadImageToStorage(file: File, bucket: string)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Multiple bucket support (blog-images, blog-featured-images)
- ✅ URL parsing for file path extraction
- ✅ Detailed cleanup reporting

#### **2. Deferred Image Upload Component** (`src/components/admin/DeferredImageUpload.tsx`)
```typescript
interface DeferredImageData {
  file: File | null
  previewUrl: string
  uploaded: boolean
  uploadedUrl?: string
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Drag & drop file upload
- ✅ File validation (type, size)
- ✅ Image preview with metadata
- ✅ Upload status indicators
- ✅ Professional UI design

### **Updated Components**

#### **1. Blog Deletion API** (`src/app/api/blog/posts/[slug]/route.ts`)
**Enhanced DELETE endpoint:**
```typescript
// Before deletion:
1. Fetch blog post with image URLs
2. Delete content images from blog_images table
3. Delete featured/hero images from storage
4. Delete blog post record
5. Return cleanup summary
```

#### **2. Blog Creation Form** (`src/app/admin/pages/blog/new/page.tsx`)
**Enhanced with deferred uploads:**
```typescript
// New state management:
- featuredImage: DeferredImageData
- heroImage: DeferredImageData

// Upload flow:
1. User selects image → Preview shown
2. User clicks publish → Images uploaded to Supabase
3. Blog post created with uploaded URLs
```

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### **Image Cleanup Process**
```sql
-- Images tracked in blog_images table:
SELECT id, file_path, filename, blog_post_id 
FROM blog_images 
WHERE blog_post_id = ?

-- Storage buckets cleaned:
- blog-images (content and hero images)
- blog-featured-images (featured images)
```

### **Deferred Upload Process**
```typescript
// Upload sequence during publish:
1. Upload featured image → blog-featured-images bucket
2. Upload hero image → blog-images bucket  
3. Create blog post with uploaded URLs
4. Save image metadata to blog_images table
```

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

- **Feedback**: Admin receives cleanup summary

### **Featured Image Upload**
